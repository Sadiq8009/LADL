private key case could read mail encrypted sign messages private key rsa generally believed resistant standard cryptanalytic techniques even standard key bits ripem long enough render impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring breaking des would allow attacker read given message since message encrypted des would allow attacker claim des bits key thus could conceivably compromised brute force sufficient hardware agencies money devote simply read one message since message different des key work message would remain high key management attacks stealing private key would allow benefits breaking rsa safeguard encrypted des key derived passphrase type however attacker get copy private keyfile passphrase snooping network packets tapping lines whatever could break whole scheme main risk transferring either passphrase private key file across untrusted link run ripem trusted machine preferably one sitting right front ideally machine home maybe office nobody else physical access fooling accepting bogus public key someone else could allow opponent deceive sending secret messages rather real recipient enemy fool intended recipient well could encrypt messages

mutable evolve without delving deep discussion creationism vs evolutionism god created original genetic code perfect without flaw evidence code perfect degraded ever since evidence favour statement perhaps biggest imperfection code full non coding regions introns called intervene coding regions exons impressive amount evidence suggests introns ancient origin likely early exons represented early protein domains number introns decreasing increasing appears intron loss occur species common ancestry usually quite similar exon intron structure genes hand possibility introns inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns removed splicing mechanism would present unused introns inserted moreover intron insertion would required precise targeting random insertion would tolerated since sequences intron removal self splicing mrna conserved besides transposition sequence usually leaves trace long terminal repeats target site duplications found near intron sequences seriously recommend reading textbooks molecular biology genetics posting theological arguments like try watson molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimore molecular biology cell starters remember question posed theological context god cause disease newborns answer likewise theological perspective less valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail fulfil criterion think misread meaning said god made genetic code perfect mean perfect certainly evolved since worse would please cite references support assertion assertion less valid scientific perspective unless support evidence fact claimed parasites diseases perhaps important thought instance sex might evolved defence parasites view supported computer simulations evolution eg tierra perhaps thought higher energy rays like x rays gamma rays cosmic rays caused damage fact thermal energy damage although usually mild easily fixed enzymatic action actually neither us knows atmosphere like time god created life according recollection biologists claim life began billion years ago would half billion years earth created would still primitive support life seem remember figure like billion years ago origination life earth anyone better estimate replace created formed since need invoke creator earth formed without one recent estimates age

disbelieve right path walk take look evidence present one conclusions prior theology use method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusions human dna complex tends accumulate errors adversely affecting well ability fight disease simpler dna bacteria viruses tend become efficient causing infection disease bad combination hence newborns suffer genetic viral bacterial diseases

nothing evil god fault explanation work fails miserably may right fact know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exists would inconceivable might responsible many ills affect mankind think could done much better job pun intended problem seems satan necessary explain diseases inevitable product evolution say seems like another bad inference actually done oversimplify said
