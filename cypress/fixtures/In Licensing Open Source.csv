I think you will find this could be valuable to OIDD customers and they can go download and use the program without cost under the the GPL3. DataWarrior can handle extremely large datasets, calculate properties, fingerprints for searching and similarity, clustering, display structures and various plots of calculated and imported data.

One of the products, Visium, allows this to be performed on tissue sections instead of dissociated cells, which is a monumental step forward.  One step of this technology requires aligning an image of the tissue section to registration or 'fiduciary' marks on the slide.  The output of this is a file that is provided to the program that processes the gene expression data (that program is 'SpaceRanger' and has already been installed in the Lilly computing environment, a variation of that program is 'CellRanger').  In addition, this software is used to view the outputs of 'SpaceRanger' when the data processing is complete.  The Visium technology is being explored by multiple therapeutic areas in both the preclinical and clinical areas, and thus the need to utilize this software is substantial.

Nokogiri is the most widely used and maintained library for this purpose on Ruby. There are other Ruby libraries (eg&%2358; REXML) that perform similar operations but in comparison testing they do not perform as well and/or they are not as easy to implement. In short, Nokogiri is the best ruby gem currently available. </div>
<div>&%23160;</div>
<div>For the Medical Cascade project in Lilly, Nokogiri is specifically used to parse the generated HTML and remove specific tags. Without the gem, the parsing and replacing could potentially be implemented with a find and replace approach, however efficiencies would be lost and additional custom logic would be required to assure proper formatted HTML - which Nokogiri handles.</div>
<div>&%23160;</div>
<div>In general, it is best Ruby development practice to utilize Nokogiri to parse and manipulate XML, HTML, and long documents among others. Search and replace implementations are limited to short text strings. </div>
<div>&%23160;</div>
<div>Maintaining and Supporting<br>Since Nokogiri is a gem, once it is installed it does not require any updates or additional support. If a newer version supports a specific desired feature or in the unlikely event that a security vulnerability is detected in Nokogiri, a newer version can easily be installed using the bundler application followed by testing of existing code.</div>","<div></div>","Allan Kirui","Approved","<div></div>",,"<div></div>","[""Enterprise""]","No",,

To achieve this, OBS Studio first projects the speaker (captured by the laptop camera) onto the slides. Next, the presenter shares the processed slides through a virtual camera (part of OBS Studio) instead of using the sharing screen function. To put it to context, a presenter will turn on his/her camera on Teams and the slides will show through the camera. This way, only one screen is required (which is the turned-on camera) so there's no need for a separate side box (as in the case of screen sharing and at the same time turning on the camera).

<div>Stature is a global m&amp;Q IT application that is used by the Technical Services/Manufacturing Sciences business are to conduct manufacturing risk assessments.&%23160; Internally, the system generates large amount of data in the form of a study (roughly 600-1000 pages of printed data) to document the risk assessment.&%23160; The business is required to keep the studies living inthe system and update them frequently when implementing corrective actions to prevent future manufacturing deviations or to make process improvements.&%23160; Once a study has been approved for the first time, subsequent updates are typically limited in scope and may only change 50 pit of 75,000 lines of data.&%23160; Scientific and Quality reviewers and approvers need a way to quickly identify changes between two revisions of a study and make sure that no data was inadvertently&%23160;changes.&%23160; Currently, the business is relying on analysis to take detailed notes about what aspects of the data have changes, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.&%23160; </div>

Due to its simplicity, it is very easy and straightforward to add your own analysis module.
